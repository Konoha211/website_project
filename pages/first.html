I saw you in the mirror<br>
You were wearing your hair differently<br>
Carrying the air differently<br>
You said you wear your hair long parted in the middle<br>
Long in solidarity just like all his women<br>
<br>
In Long Beach<br>
<br>
Aimless<br>
<br>
Your fingers wiping oil on the paper with precision<br>
With decision like an artist never seen yet with a vision<br>
<br>
With a reason<br>
Stared with venom at the ceiling<br>
Not the grass<br>
But straight ahead<br>
Just At the skyline<br>
With precision<br>
Laser vision<br>
<br>
<a href="second.html">Time was stopping</a><br>
Moving through you<br>
You dictated<br>
By what moved you<br>
<br>
Only moving never thinking<br>
<br>
Match the sun that's slowly sinking<br>
At the height of the afternoon<br>
In the heat of the summer evening<br>
Like a phoenix like a chem trail like a wavelength No<br>
One's claiming<br>
<br>
Georgia o Keefe<br>
Georgia peaches<br>
Doing nothing but your painting<br>
For forever<br>
Forget teachers<br>
Forgive him for ever leaving<br>
<br>
Love is rising<br>
No resisting<br>
Cheeks are flushing<br>
Now you're living<br>
<br>
Say goodbye now<br>
No resisting<br>
Live your life like<br>
<a href="third.html">No one's listening</a><br>
<br>
Be the art the life is breathing<br>
Be the soul the world is living<br>
<br>
For you only<br>
Not for giving<br>
Just for taking<br>
No one's listening<br>
<br>
At the end of Rose and Rich<br>
Down the street that's green and winding<br>
Past the bushes cypress thriving<br>
Past the chain link fence and driving<br>
Further down the road less travelled<br>
There you are athleisure wear unraveled<br>
Now I see you clear<br>
<br>
Standing stoic blue and denim<br>
Eyes not blue but clear like<br>
Heaven<br>
<br>
You don't want to be forgotten<br>
<br>
<a href="forth.html">You just want to disappear</a></p>
